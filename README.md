# XRewinded
Bringing justice back to those who can't access Twitter/ùïè

So, almost all of us know that Twitter/X has been banned from Brasil, I'm planning on making an app similar to X that allows brazilian people access their acconts back and keep posting like nothing ever happended in the first place.

XRewinded is a platform designed to allow users to reconnect with their X/Twitter accounts in a compliant and secure manner. This project is open-source so anyone can contribute and help!
